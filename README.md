# Cognifyz-P1
This project builds a machine learning model to predict restaurant ratings using various restaurant attributes such as location, cuisines, price range, vote counts, and service features. The goal is to understand what factors influence ratings and to create a model that can accurately estimate a restaurant’s rating before it receives user reviews.


📌 Project Objective

To develop a regression model that predicts a restaurant’s aggregate rating based on its features and analyze the most influential attributes affecting customer ratings.

🧠 What This Project Includes

✔ Data preprocessing
✔ Handling missing values
✔ Encoding categorical variables
✔ Feature scaling
✔ Training machine learning models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)
✔ Model evaluation using metrics
✔ Feature importance analysis
✔ Visualizations (heatmaps, bar charts, correlations)

🗂️ Dataset Information

The dataset contains restaurant-related features such as:

* Name

* City

* Cuisines

* Price Range

* Online Delivery

* Table Booking

* Votes

* Average Cost for Two

* Aggregate Rating

These features are used to predict the restaurant’s rating.
